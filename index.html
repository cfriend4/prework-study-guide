      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the main language used to display conent on a website.</li>
        <li>An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of an HTML document </li>
        <li>The head element contains meta information about the webpage for the browser.</li>
        <li>We add links to related files in the head element to tell the browser what is included in our website and how these files should interact.</li>
        <li>The body element reprsents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>A child element is an element nested inside another element.</li>
        <li>An element refers to an entire element from opening to closing tag.</li>
        <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

    <section class = "card" id = "css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS: applies to a specific HTML tag. Useful for quick changes but less flexible than other options because each style must be edited if you make a design change.</li>
        <li>Internal Style Sheet: Contains style rules for the web page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External Style Sheet - Preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file.</li>
        <li> When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element places in the HTML's head.</li>
        <li> Within CSS, we can designate a class selector by using .[class name] with styling and then applying it within HTML elements.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>git checkout - b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git checkout main: switch to main branch</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: pulls the most up to date version of main to your local device</li>

        <li>git commit -m "add a message": commit a change to the repository and add a message</li>

        <li>git push origin [branch name]: pushes all of our changes</li>

      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named contained that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Use the const keyword to declare a variable that cannot be changed.</li>
        <li>The strict equality operator === checks to see if two values are equal, and will return true or false.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
        <li>Arrays can story multiple data types within a single array.</li>
        <li>In JavasScript and other programing languages, arrays are zero indexed and sequential, meaning that the first item in an array will have index zero and the index of the item will increase by one for each.</li>
        <li>Use the let keyword to assign a variable that can be reassigned.</li>
        <li>The .forEach() method can be used as an alternative to a for loop for iterating over arrays.</li>
        <li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in script. In Javascript it is executed from top to bottom of your file.</li>
        <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer to do a certain task.</li>
        <li>Unlike for loops or conditional statements, functions do not automatically execute and must be called by name in order to execute it.</li>
        <li>Functions make our code more reuseable because we can call it as many times as we need.</li>
        <li>A function declaration consists of the function keyword follow by the name of the function. </li>
        <li>To call a function - type the function name followed by parentheses.</li>
